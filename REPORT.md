**AUTHORS:** <>

**DATE:** 15 April 2025

## Introduction
This project aims to extract and analyze climate policy documents from the NDC registry, focusing on the following key questions:

1. What does the country promise as their emissions reduction target?

2. What year are they using as baseline?

3.  What promises under this new version of the document are different from the previous version of their NDC?

4. What policies or strategies does the country propose to meet its targets?

5. Do they specify what sectors of their economy will be the hardest to reduce emissions in?
